# Remora Backup Bootstrap App

Remora Backup is a secure, simple, yet powerful offsite backup service for your Heroku Postgres database. We operate with the belief that your data is the lifeblood of your business, and offsite backups are a must. While Heroku does a great job protecting your data, it's always a good idea to have an offsite backup. And sometimes it's not just a good idea, as it's often a legal requirement for certain industries.
